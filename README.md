This is a Lua script designed for Aseprite. It works by aggregating pixel data and turns it into a written pattern. 
For now it's only truly optimised for some colors and regularly misidentifies other colors, but it gives them a name, which looks better than a hex code. 
I don't really know what else to say, if you need any help with it shoot me a Discord dm @blip.blip.blip
