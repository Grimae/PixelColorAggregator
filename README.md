This is a Lua script designed for Aseprite. It works by aggregating pixel data and turns it into a written pattern. 
For now it's only truly optimised for black and white, I plan on making it work on other colors. 
I don't really know what more to say, if you need any help with it shoot me a Discord dm @blip.blip.blip
